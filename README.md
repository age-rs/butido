# BUTIDO

"butido" could stand for "but i do", "BUild Things In DOcker" or
"Better Universal Task Instrumentation Docker Obersavtor".

Anyways, it is a tool for building packages for linux distributions in docker
and it does not make assumptions about the build procedure itself (and thus can
build .rpm, .deb, or any other package format your scripts can build).
